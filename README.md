# simpleline
Tiny and fairly simple powerline replacement just for me, with only the things I want. 
In plain C.

I wanted a bare bones, speedy, dynamic prompt similar to what I had with powerline. It has no configuration beyond getting your hands dirty and changing the code or the #defines at the top.

I managed to do this without any libraries - although I would have used one if I needed to. I used C rather than C++, as I've been writing C for micro-controllers a bit lately and I wanted to see if I my old C skills are still good ;-)

It's grown a little over time, as I find useful things to add.
